# Hello World

This app has been designed to be a LockerDome App at it's most simple, and its designed to empower you to learn by playing.

There are a few helper files that any starting LD Apper would benefit from.

1. app_platform.js: This is a mini-glossary of the privileged postMessage calls you can make, as well as a library to simplify serving content into an iframe on our site.

2. api_ops: This is a mini-glossary of our api calls, as well as a library to simplify making the api calls down to a simple function-callback pattern. It relies on api_request being in the same directory as it.

3. api_request: If you are new to NodeJS, or if you haven't written an app for LockerDome before, this is a useful file because it handles many of the basic elements of sending an api call to us.
